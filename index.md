## Welcome to the Cambridge Python User Group

This is the very start of a home page for CamPUG, the Cambridge Python User Group.

That's the Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England.

We meet once a month, normally on the first Tuesday, and normally at the Raspberry Pi Foundation offices, 30 Station Road, Cambridge, CB1 2JH. Meetings are from 7pm until 9pm, and afterwards some of us normally go on to the pub.

**Thanks to the Ben Nuttall of the Raspberry Pi Foundation for allowing us to use their meeting room.**

For the moment, here are some useful links:

* We have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/campug/organisational/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.rst). Please read it.
* Our main information resource is [CamPUG on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG). Go there to find out about current and future meetings.
* Ben Nuttall sometimes tweets for us. See https://twitter.com/campython
* In theory we have a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/campug), but it has been inactive for a little while.
* We're just about to announce a slack channel - come back soon to find out more.
