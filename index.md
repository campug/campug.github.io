## Welcome to the Cambridge Python User Group

That's the Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England.

We get together once a month to talk about anything related to the Python programming language.

Anyone who is interested in Python is welcome, whatever your level of knowledge (we're very happy to help with questions from those just learning the language), and for whatever purpose you use it.

We meet on the first Tuesday of each month, normally at the Raspberry Pi Foundation offices, 37 Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 1NT. Meetings are from 7pm until 9pm, and afterwards some of us go on to the pub.

[Find out about our meetings at meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG).

**Thank you to Ben Nuttall and the Raspberry Pi Foundation for use of the meeting room and facilities.**
