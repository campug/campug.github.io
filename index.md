## Welcome to the Cambridge Python User Group

That's the Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England.

We get together once a month to talk about anything related to the Python programming language.

Anyone who is interested in Python is welcome, whatever your level of knowledge (we're very happy to help with questions from those just learning the language), and for whatever purpose you use it.

We meet on the first Tuesday of each month, normally at the Raspberry Pi Foundation offices, 30 Station Road, Cambridge, CB1 2JH. Meetings are from 7pm until 9pm, and afterwards some of us go on to the pub.

**Thank you to Ben Nuttall and the Raspberry Pi Foundation for use of the meeting room and facilities.**

For the moment, here are some useful links:

* We have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/campug/organisational/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.rst) which describes what is or is not acceptable behaviour of members. Basically, be kind and considerate of others. Please read it. It applies to meetings and to our various online media.
* Our main information resource is [CamPUG on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG). Go there to find out about current and future meetings.
* Ben Nuttall sometimes tweets for us. See [https://twitter.com/campython](https://twitter.com/campython)
* In theory we have a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/campug), but it has been inactive for a little while.
* We're just about to announce a slack channel - come back soon to find out more.
