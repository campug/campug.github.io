## Welcome to the Cambridge Python User Group

That's the Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England.

We get together once a month to talk about anything related to the Python programming language.

Anyone who is interested in Python is welcome, whatever your level of knowledge (we're very happy to help with questions from those just learning the language), and for whatever purpose you use it.

We meet virtually on the first Tuesday of each month from 7pm for an hour or two.  Occasionally we will meet socially in-person at a Cambridge pub.

[Find out about our meetings at meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG).

**Thank you to &DEV for the continued sponsorship of Meetup and Zoom.**
