## How CamPUG uses meetup.com

We mainly use meetup as a way of publicising meetings, at which it is very good. We also use the RSVP mechanism to get some idea of how many people will turn up to a meeting, but this is very inaccurate - at best, we normally get
between half and two-thirds of the "yes" numbers attending.

We do not require people to pay for meetings, or acquire tickets, and we do not "take a register" of who actually turns up. We don't even insist that people have to use meetup to indicate they're coming. It is important to me that this be a free and open meeting.

This does mean that we have a problem when a meeting is very popular and reaches the practical room size - i.e., how many will safely fit in our meeting room (although we've really only had that problem once so far).

From March 2018, I shall put a limit on the number of "yes" RSVP replies that is larger than the actual room size, but hopefully not too large. I shall try harder to send a message or messages before each meeting to remind people to un-RSVP if they cannot come, and I shall count the actual number of attendees to each meeting and monitor the situation.
